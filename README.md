# Western Health COVID-19 app

A tool to safeguard the welfare of Western Health anaesthetists during COVID-19 and provide instant access to the most up-to-date information for time-critical procedures to ensure optimal patient care.  This app will contain information for frontline medical staff on subjects such as:

- Putting on and taking off PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
- Taking care of your own welfare
- Intubation checklists and steps
- Ventilation suggested initial actions and adjuncts
- ICU General Care
- ICU Tips for junior staffers
- Contact details and newsfeeds

Currently under development by a community of volunteers.

If you've never used Github here's a [Github101.md](docs/GITHUB101.md) to get you started with the basics.

## Development process

Everything is co-ordinated through github issues.  The current development process is:

üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Gregg Miller** and other Western Health staff provide features, content and suggestions via GitHub issues.  Gregg & Co can create new issues for features to add, things that need changing, etc.  

If you need any help from the WH staff, you can label an issue as `Medic`.  [These issues currently need medic advice](https://github.com/Western-Health-Covid19-Collaboration/wh_covid19_app/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AMedic). You can also `@` mention and assign issues to `@Western-Health-Covid19-Collaboration/medical` in a comment to notify the whole WH team.

The WH staff can label issues as `#1 Priority`, `#2 Priority`, `#3 Priority`.  Everybody on the team should focus on #1 priority issues first, then #2 and so on.

Once a issue has all the appropriate info it, it can be labeled `design` to hand over to the next step ...

‚¨áÔ∏è

üë©‚Äçüé®üë®‚Äçüé® **Marc Edwards** and other designers help design and specify features.  They  upload designs to zeplin and add design guidance into the issues.  

If you need any help from the design team, you can label an issue as `design`.  [These issues currently need design guidance](https://github.com/Western-Health-Covid19-Collaboration/wh_covid19_app/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign).   You can also `@` mention `@Western-Health-Covid19-Collaboration/designers` in a comment to notify the whole design team.

Once they have done their ‚ú® magic ‚ú® the issue should be labeled as 'Ready for dev' ...

‚¨áÔ∏è
 
üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª **Developers** pick up [ready for Dev issues](https://github.com/Western-Health-Covid19-Collaboration/wh_covid19_app/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Ready+for+Dev%22+) and submit PRs to the project when then get approved and merged.  If you are working on developing an issue, be sure to assign yourself to it, or mention that you are working on it.
 
If your committing changes to the docs only add `[skip ci]` to your commit message to save build time.
 
‚¨áÔ∏è

üñ• **CI** builds the app and deploys to phones via firebase app distribution.

## The Plan

We will rapidly build out functionality and screens. The plan is to ship early, and ship often, deploying new builds at least once a day via CI.

Currently all data will be stored inside the app, with no CMS or web services. The app should have minimal logic, and instead just focuses on providing important information in a mobile friendly format.

### Information architecture

The app will have these screens and sections:

![App information architecture](docs/Flow-Diagram.png "The information architecture of the app")

### Screenshots

The complete set of designs are in Zeplin, but this gives some indication of how the the app will look:

## Getting Started & Development

You will need to install and setup Flutter to develop this application. You can read more on how to set up Flutter [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

**Tip!**: If you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE (Code Editor), the [Flutter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) is really useful and helpful to perform multiple actions such as:

- the installation of depencies
- running the application

### Installing dependencies

To install dependencies, simply run `flutter pub get` in your terminal.

### Developing the app

#### iOS

Initialise an instance of an iOS Simulator or connect physical iOS device, navigate to the cloned repo and run from root:

```sh
# from terminal

open -a simulator

cd desktop/muhnee-app
flutter run -d "iPhone"
```

#### Android

##### Keychain Certificate Setup

1. Download the `google-services.json` configuration file from the Firebase Project and move it to the directory `<PROJECT-ROOT>/android/app`
2. Get the Android Keychain by:

   ```
   keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass a
   ndroid
   ```

3. Copy either the SHA1 or the SHA256 certificate fingerprint onto the Android App on [Firebase Console]()

##### Development

If you have a device plugged in just run:

```
flutter run
```

Otherwise if you have setup [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and/or the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) you can run it over a virtual Android emulator using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). Just simply run:

```
flutter run adb
```

### Pull Request Process

## Method 1 - If you are part of the team
- Develop your work in a branch. Branch names should be prefixed with `feature`, `tech`, or `bugfix` depending on what is being done in them. eg: `feature\update-readme`
- Open a pull request into master. Be sure to include a detailed description in your pull request. Other contributors will comment on your code or approve it
- Please be sure to note the build status of your PR reported by the Codemagic CI
- Once your pull request has been approved, please merge into master.

## Method 2 - If you are not yet part of the team
- If you are not a part of the team, you can still work on the code by clicking on the `Fork` option in this page.
- Once you have forked to your own github account,  you will be able to check out the fork and work on it.
- To create a pull request, you would have to push your local changes back to your git account. 
- You would then find the option to `Compare and Pull Request`. 
- Please follow the instructions above on how to submit a pull request. 
- Once the pull request is reviewed and approved by the team, they would be able to merge this with the main branch.
