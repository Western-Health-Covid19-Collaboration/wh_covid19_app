# WHAC19 - Western Health Anaesthesia Covid-19

The WHAC19 app is a tool to safeguard the welfare of Western Health anaesthetists during COVID-19 and provide instant access to the most up-to-date information for time-critical procedures to ensure optimal patient care.  This app will contain information for frontline medical staff on subjects such as:

- Putting on and taking off PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
- Taking care of your own welfare
- Intubation and Extubation checklists and steps
- Ventilation suggested initial actions and adjuncts
- ICU General Care
- ICU Tips your daily round and cross-skilling
- Contact details and newsfeeds

Currently under development by a community of volunteers.

If you've never used Github here's a [Github101.md](docs/GITHUB101.md) to get you started with the basics.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the development of the app, please read [the contribution documentation](contributing.md).


## The Plan

We will rapidly build out functionality and screens. The plan is to ship early, and ship often, deploying new builds at least once a day via CI.

Currently all data will be stored inside the app, with no CMS or web services. The app should have minimal logic, and instead just focuses on providing important information in a mobile friendly format.

### Information architecture

The app will have these screens and sections:

### Screenshots

The complete set of designs are in Zeplin, but this gives some indication of how the the app will look:
